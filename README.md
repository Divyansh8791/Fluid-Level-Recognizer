# Fluid-Level-Recognizer
The Fluid Level Recognizer is an innovative system designed to monitor and control the fluid level in a tank. Using Arduino programming, C language, and IoT-based sensors like HCSR04, ESP-32, ESP8266, and a one-channel relay module, this project ensures efficient and automated fluid management.
